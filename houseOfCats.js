// There are some people and cats in a house. 
// You are given the number of legs they have all together. 
// Your task is to return an array containing every possible number of people that could be in the house 
// sorted in ascending order. 
// It's guaranteed that each person has 2 legs and each cat has 4 legs.
// Example
// For legs = 6, the output should be houseOfCats(legs) = [1, 3].
// There could be either 1 cat and 1 person (4 + 2 = 6) or 3 people (2 * 3 = 6).
// For legs = 2, the output should be houseOfCats(legs) = [1].
// There can be only 1 person.
