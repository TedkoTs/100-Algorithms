// Being a new Uber user, you have $20 off your first ride.
// You want to make the most out of it and drive in the fanciest car you can afford, 
// without spending any out-of-pocket money. 
// There are 5 options, from the least to the most expensive: "UberX", "UberXL", "UberPlus", "UberBlack" and "UberSUV".
// You know the length l of your ride in miles and how much one mile costs for each car. Find the best car you can afford.
// Example
// For l = 30 and fares = [0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1, 1.3], the output should be fancyRide(l, fares) = "UberXL".
// The cost for the ride in this car would be $15, which you can afford, but "UberPlus" would cost $21, 
// which is too much for you.
